To find out more about the raw data, visit the above listed website or view the README that accomanies the raw data download. \n\n---\n\n##Script Description:\n\nBelow is a step by step description of the script. First however a quick summary:\n\nFirst the script checks for existance of the Raw data, and then prompts the user to name their final data file. The script then loads the relevant files and libraries, and binds related files together. Along the way the script constantly removes unneeded files/values/ and variables to limit memory use.Next it determines which measearments are needed, and creates a column list, which it uses to extract only the relevant measurements and their associated names. Finally it adds all the data files together, all with descriptive names for both the Activities and the measurements.It take this chopped data and calculates the Mean of each measurement for every activity and subject:\n\nie For Walking, Subject 2, it calculates the mean of all 66 measurements that related to mean or Standard Deviation.\n\nIt writes the output of this to a .txt file called by default \"clean_tidy\" name that name.txt\n\n### Script Flow\n This script does the following things:\n\n1) Checks for existance of UCI HAR Dataset folder in the current WD. And prompts for final file name \n2) Loads required packages. See Code Book and Read Me for more info.\n3) Reads in all the data containing files from the Dataset. See Code book for info.\n4) Binds together the test and train data:\n         <br>a) binds together the measurement data\n         <br>b) binds together the activity data\n         <br>c) binds together the subject data\n5) removes used files\n6) finds the features that contain mean() or std(), and makes a sorted list of the column numbers\n7) Uses that list to extract just those variables from the measurement data\n8) Makes a list of variable names by using the column numbers list again.\n9) Adds column names to the remaining four data/label files:\n        <br>a) selc-measurement-data: column names now represent the measurements\n        <br>b) activity_data: simiply labeled with \"Activity\" to enable merging later\n        <br>c) subject_data: Labeled with \"Subject-ID\", as it had no name previously\n        <br>d) activity_labels: Labeled with \"Activity\" to enable merge, and \"Activity-Name\" for description\n10) Binds the three data files together\n11) removes unnecessary files/values\n12) Merges the activity-labels file with the full-data file to give descriptive activity names\n13) Removes everything but the now Clean, Intermediate File.\n14) Converts Clean-Intermediate to a tbl_df file to enable DPLYR package functions\n15) removes old clean_intermediate DF\n16) Removes redundant Activity column using select(-Activity), which just contains numbers not names. \n17) groups CI-tbl-df by Activity-Name and Subject_ID\n18) Removes the ungrouped CI-tbl-df\n19) Runs the mean function on each variable for each activity and each subject\n20) Removes the grouped_data\n21) writes out the new Tidy data set with either write.table(file = \"x\", row.names=FALSE)or\n\twrite.table(file = \"clean_tidy.txt\", row.names=FALSE)\n\n---\n\n### Notes\nTo view variable, data, and other information view the included Codebook\n\n---\n\n### License\nThis data was provided under license from \n\n[1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L.
